# Flask Calculator Exercise-
Create a simple Calculator App using Flask
This will use the URL query parameters to get 
the numbers to be calculated with.

This Flask app uses 4 different routes (math operations)
with two numbers (a and b), to pass in as URL GET-style query 
parameters. 

For example, a URL like http://localhost:5000/add?a=10&b=20 
should return a string response of exactly 30.
