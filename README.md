# Flask-
Flask Greet and Calculator Exercise

Creat a Greet App using Flask 
In the greet folder, Make a simple Flask app that responds to these routes with simple text messages:
/welcome
Returns “welcome”
/welcome/home
Returns “welcome home”
/welcome/back
Return “welcome back”


Create a simple Calculator App using Flask
This will use the URL query parameters to get 
the numbers to be calculated with.

This Flask app uses 4 different routes (math operations)
with two numbers (a and b), to pass in as URL GET-style query 
parameters. 

For example, a URL like http://localhost:5000/add?a=10&b=20 
should return a string response of exactly 30.
